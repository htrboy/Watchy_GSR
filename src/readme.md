The current source for the Watchy "face".

BE sure to read the compilation instructions or this will not compile.

Changes I've made are to allow encapsulating a watchface in a header file to keep the code more modular (my preference).  This is based on dezign999's code - see other fork in my repositories.  Also check out dezign999's watchfaces - they're pretty awesome!

Working on adding getting weather to the base code for any watchface that wants to call it.
